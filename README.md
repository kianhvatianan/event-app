## Event Registration and Management System  

### Background  
In today's digital era, online organizations frequently host virtual events on platforms like Google Meet, Zoom, and Discord to engage their members. Managing these events effectively requires a structured system where administrators can create events, manage participants, and ensure a smooth registration process. Simultaneously, members need a convenient way to explore upcoming events and register for them without accessing unnecessary event credentials until they have successfully registered.  

### Objectives  
- **Simplify Event Management:** Provide an easy-to-use platform for administrators to create, edit, and manage online events.  
- **Efficient Member Registration:** Allow members to register for events and view their registered event details in a personalized dashboard.  
- **Controlled Access to Event Credentials:** Prevent public access to event links and credentials, ensuring only registered members can access them.  
- **Transparency:** Display ongoing and upcoming events with limited information (title, date, image, and description) on the homepage without exposing event credentials.
